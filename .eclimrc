### On unix platforms (linux, mac, bsd) eclim supports an optional .eclimrc file located in your home directory. In this file you may supply any system properties or vm args which you would like passed to eclimd at startup. The format of this file is the same as the standard java properties file format with the exception of any vm args which you would like to include.

## Ex.

# Bind eclimd to all interfaces
### nailgun.server.host=0.0.0.0

# Specifies the port that nailgun / eclimd listens on for client requests.
### nailgun.server.port=10012

# Specifies the workspace directory to use
# See $ECLIPSE_HOME/configuration/config.ini for other osgi properties.
### osgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/myworkspace

# increase heap size
-Xmx256M

# increase perm gen size
-XX:PermSize=64m
-XX:MaxPermSize=128m

### The eclim client will also utilize this file, but only to determine the nailgun server port should you choose to change the default.
